## Description

The GREat Escape is an educational platformer game that helps teach college students GRE vocabulary words.

An organization known as the Bookworm Organization has stolen all vocabulary books! They are demanding that college students pay exorbitant fees in order to prepare for the GRE. Their money-grubbing ways are heinous and corrupt! With no hope in sight, 1 captive chooses to make their escape through the Bookworm Headquarters, stealing back books and gaining knowledge along the way in order to give to all of their fellow college students!

The game features various levels of difficulty, starting with easier words and working up to the longer and more complex words. 

## Gameplay

The gameplay of the GREat Escape comes in 2 parts: Collect/Learn, and Testing

Collect/Learn sections of the game are platformers where the player must collect all of the Books in the world in order to finish the level. They then learn the definitions of all the words they've collected and once that is over, they head to the Testing section.

Testing sections come in the form of Boss fights where the Boss can only be defeated by correctly defining words in a certain time limit. IF this is completed the player defeats the Boss and continues on to the next Collect/Learn section.

## Specifications

The GREat Escape runs on Unity 5.4, and is written in C#.
